                                                <br>
                                                <p>David Warner had one of the most memorable debuts in international cricket, when he was plucked from obscurity - without having played a single First-Class match - and made a stunning 89 off 43 balls in
                                                    a T20l against South Africa. The innings was all the more remarkable due to its timing, coming as it did after a morale-shattering home Test series loss for Australia in 2008-09. </p>
                                                <p>With T20 success, he made his ODI debut against the South Africans in Hobart. An aggressive 69 in just his second ODI seemed to confirm the rare talent of Warner. However, as the ODIs progressed, his form
                                                    dipped and he was axed before forcing his way back into the side. He continued to impress in the T20 format of the game, and was one of the few bright spots during Australia's first round exit in the
                                                    2009 edition of the T20 WC in England.</p>
                                                <p>With a slot opening up in the Australian Test squad, Warner was one among the many choices. Already a regular in the ODI line-up, Warner made his Test debut against New Zealand in the Australian summer of
                                                    2011. After a modest debut at the Gabba, Warner came into his own with a career-defining century in Hobart. He belied expectations and became the 13th Australian opener to carry his bat through an innings.
                                                    If the knock in Hobart was full of grit and determination, he showed another side of his batting abilities when he blasted a listless Indian bowling attack to all parts of the WACA during a stunning
                                                    career-best knock of 180. </p>
                                                <p>Warner’s aggressive touch at the top of the order was in full flow once again when he creamed a superb 119 against a top notch South African attack at the Adelaide Oval in 2012. On 12th June 2013, Warner
                                                    was dropped for Australia's second match in 2013 ICC Champions Trophy game against New Zealand for disciplinary reasons. It later emerged that he had tried to punch Joe Root. The event happened hours
                                                    after Saturday's loss to England at Edgbaston. On 13th June 2013, the board announced that Warner was to be fined £7,000 (AU $11,500) and would not play for his country until the first Ashes Test on
                                                    10th July, 2013. Warner, subsequently, missed the rest of the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy and the tour matches against Somerset and Worcestershire. </p>
                                                <P>In the Ashes series in Australia in 2013-14, he scored runs freely and emerged as the highest run-scorer. He scored 523 runs from five matches at an average of 58.11, which included two hundreds and two
                                                    fifties. Despite his heroics, Delhi didn't retain him for the IPL season 2014 and he was later snapped up in the auctions in February 2014 by Hyderabad for a whopping amount of Rs 5.5 crores.</P>

                                                    <br>
                                                    <p>Having made his name initially as a potential leg-spinner who could bat a bit, there was immense criticism, even among those in Australia over the quality of his selection during his early days in international
                                                        cricket. However, they were made to eat humble pie as the enigmatic man from New South Wales turned things around in sensational fashion to feature among the best batsmen in the world.</p>
                                                    <p> It was the 2007-08 domestic season when Smith made his debut across formats. He was known to give the ball a fair rip and could generate a lot of turn as a leg spinner. His boyish charm and the run up
                                                        to the crease even drew comparisons with the legendary Shane Warne who had just retired from international cricket a season or so before. Smith's talent was evident but he was too raw for the big
                                                        stage. In a couple of years, the national call-up came with the limited-overs debut happening in February 2010. The tour of England later that year saw his initiation in the longest format as well.
                                                        Smith started off as a player who could bat at 7 or 8 apart from bowling his leggies. However, there was still a lot of rawness in his skill set. His selection during the Ashes series of 2010-11
                                                        drew a lot of contempt and after Australia lost the urn, his career also faded a touch, being dropped from all formats of the game. There was a feeling among the pundits that the bloke had more talent
                                                        with the bat than with the ball. There was certainly a lot of courage about Smith the batsman and he started working more consciously on it. The former Australian great Greg Chappell once remarked
                                                        that Smith was the best batting talent in the country. In the coming years, he would be proved right in a big way. </p><br>
                                                    <p>Fittingly, it was an Ashes series that showcased Smith's resurgence. During the trip of England in 2013, he exhibited a far more improved level of batsmanship, sprinkled with a good dose of grit and
                                                        mental strength. The unorthodox technique had only grown with an exaggerated trigger movement and shuffle across the stumps, all of which raised eyebrows among the purists. The bottomline though,
                                                        was that it proved effective and he had an impressive series. Although Australia lost the series, the selectors decided to invest in Smith version 2.0 and the return Ashes series at home that summer
                                                        saw him continue his upward graph. There were a few crisis knocks from him, including the Ashes-sealing hundred at the MCG and he followed it up with an equally impressive tour of South Africa. His
                                                        contributions were valuable in both those series as Australia emerged victorious. If the 2013-14 season saw Smith making a strong comeback to the international arena, the following season established
                                                        him among the best in the world. A phenomenal home series against India was the starting point and he hasn't looked back ever since, racking up runs in all conditions against all kinds of attacks.
                                                        His exploits saw him ranked number one in Tests during the year 2015 and he has remained there since then, by a fairly good margin as well.

                                                            swagger and gusto. Audio and text commentators' jobs hang by a fickle thread as he pulls off some indescribable shots. And yet, when he fails to pull 'em off, our hearts sink; the day wouldn't
                                                            be as exciting as it could have been if Maxwell got going. </p>
                                                        <p>Unconventional may be an understatement to describe Maxwell's unorthodoxy; however, he rose through the ranks in conventional fashion and shot to instant fame when the 22-year old rookie clubbed
                                                            his way to the fastest fifty in domestic One-Day history in the Ryobi Cup. He followed this up with some now-familiar violent performances in the emerging players tournament and tormented the
                                                            Indian and South African sides with some fearsome hitting, scoring 59 off 23 against India and 110 off 52 against South Africa. Maxwell was handed an ODI and T20I debut, owing to his consistent
                                                            limited-over performances in the domestic circuit. He had some good all-round outings, playing the jack-of-all-trades role for Australia, including a 56 against Pakistan in his 2nd ODI. However,
                                                            he remained a fringe player and didn't manage to cement his spot in the side. However, with the backing of excellent domestic form and some useful performances in International cricket, along
                                                            with his handy off-spin bowling, he was picked in the squad for the 2012 T20 WC in Sri Lanka. </p>
                                                        <p>Maxwell continued to be impressive in the limited-overs format, and was finally handed the prized Baggy Green for the second Test against India at Hyderabad in 2013. He failed to impressed with the
                                                            bat but took four in an innings with the ball. However, he was subsequently dropped for the third Test in Mohali, where Xavier Doherty was given a chance. After Australia lost the Mohali Test,
                                                            Maxwell was given another opportunity in the final test in Delhi. Once again, he failed to make an impression with the bat and was subsequently dropped. In the upcoming IPL, however, the Big
                                                            Show was the talk of the town, having signed with the Mumbai Indians for $1 million. He was transferred to Kings XI Punjab in the 2014 edition, and struck form immediately, scoring 7 fifties
                                                            in the tournament, including 3 scores in the nineties. He was fast becoming a nightmare for the captains in the IPL; and with the boundary ropes pulled in, the big man was mis-hitting blows off

                                                    <p>Aaron James Finch is an aggressive top-order batsman, who plays for Victoria. Known for his hard-hitting and ability to finish matches, Finch earned his spot in Australia's Under-19 team for the World
                                                        Cup in 2006. </p>

                                                                Big Bash tournament. The season saw him scoring his maiden First-Class century when he scored 102 against Tasmania. He sealed his spot in Victoria Bushrangers' middle-order and starred in

                                                                in two T20I matches against the visiting English team in 2011. He justified his selection with a blistering 53 off 33 balls at the MCG in his second game to bag the Man of the Match award
                                                                and also helped Australia square the series. He then started to score consistently and nowadays, he is almost a certainty in Australia's limited overs sides. Finch grabbed eye-balls in 2013
                                                                when he smashed England all over the park in a T20I on his way to a sensational 63-ball 156, the highest individual score in that format. He continued his good form and scored heavily in

                                                                    Legend has it, that a tall, lanky 14-year-old was spotted by a club coach trying out as a wicketkeeper for the Western Suburbs. He pulled the young man aside and demanded that he ditch
                                                                    the wicketkeeping mitts – and that he would teach him how to bowl. The AFL's fabled method of scouting a body-type and building a particular skill around it seemed to be at work again,
                                                                    as it tends to work in favour of the player's ability and aptitude.
                                                                </p>

                                                                    be a fast bowler. Following the incident, the aspiring fast bowler, changed lanes and took up batting. We all know how that turned out... Starc, the teenager, seemed to have grasped fast-bowling
                                                                    quite quickly, picking up the fundamentals from the aforementioned coach, Neil D'Costa, and bowling at 135km/h by the time he was 16. In addition to athletic ability, he was said to have
                                                                    great discipline and an undying thirst for knowledge. Most crucially, however, he was a great listener, according to D'Costa. Soon after, he was selected for the New South Wales U-17s,
                                                                    and continued to rise through the ranks.
                                                                </p>

                                                                    Shield season, he took 21 wickets in 8 matches including an impressive 5 for 74 against Queensland. The first run of consistent performances by Starc came in the domestic one-day tournament
                                                                    when he took 26 wickets in 6 matches at an average of 8.12, striking once every 12 balls. Starc was named the player of the tournament, as the young prodigy catapulted his team to victory.
                                                                    This proved to be the turning point in his career and finally propelled him into the limelight for national selection. At 20, Starc was named in the squad as a backup quick bowler for

                                                                                and slowly got a hang of being a gloveman. This also opened up more opportunities for him to feature in the playing XI. He started batting in the lower middle order. The 2015-16
                                                                                season was a stellar one for Carey in Grade cricket and such was his impact that he got a call up for the Sheffield Shield later that season for the final rounds. He managed
                                                                                to catch the eye of the selectors and earned his first senior contract for South Australia for the 2016-17 season. That proved to be turning point for Carey as he became only
                                                                                the fourth gloveman ever to amass over 500 runs and affect 50 dismissals in a single Sheffield Shield Season.
                                                                            </p>
                                                                            <p>Australia's recurring problems with the wicket-keeper batsman slot has meant that Carey has been in the selectors' radar since his redemption as a cricketer. With Matthew Wade
                                                                                losing his form, it did seem like Carey would be a darkhorse for the 2017-18 Ashes squad. However, it was Tim Paine who got the nod in a stunning selection that nevertheless
                                                                                paid dividends for Australia in the series. Carey hasn't let any of this affect him and continues to make runs in Sheffield Shield apart from being a terrific wicket-keeper.
                                                                                The hard work paid off for him when he got picked up as Australia's limited-overs wicket-keeper in the latter half of 2018 and although no.7 is a bit too low for him, he has
                                                                                adjusted reasonably well, thereby gaining his maiden World Cup call..
