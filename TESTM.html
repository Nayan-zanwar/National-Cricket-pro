                    <p class="mb20"> Test cricket is the form of the sport of cricket with the longest match duration and is considered the game's highest standard. Rotary Test matches are played between national representative teams that have been granted Test status,
                        as determined and conferred by the International Cricket Council (ICC). The term Test stems from the fact that the long, gruelling matches are mentally and physically testing. Two teams of 11 players each play a four-innings match,
                        which may last up to five days (or more in the past). It is generally considered the most complete examination of a team's endurance and ability.</p>
                    <p class="mb25"> The first officially recognised Test match took place between 15 and 19 March 1877 and was played between England and Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG). In October 2012, the ICC recast the playing conditions for Test
                        matches, permitting day/night Test matches. The first day/night game took place between Australia and New Zealand at the Adelaide Oval, Adelaide, on 27 November – 1 December 2015.</p>

                    <p class="mb20"> Sides designated as "England" began to play in the late 18th century, but these teams were not truly representative. Early international cricket was disrupted by the French Revolution and the American Civil War. The earliest international
                        cricket match was between USA and Canada, on 24 and 25 September 1844. This has never been officially considered a "Test match". Tours of national English sides abroad took place, particularly to the US, Australia and New Zealand.
                        The Australian Aborigines team became the first organised overseas cricketers to tour England in 1868.</p>
                    <p class="mb20"> Two rival English tours of Australia were proposed in the early months of 1877, with James Lillywhite campaigning for a professional tour and Fred Grace for an amateur one. Grace's tour fell through and it was Lillywhite's team that
                        toured New Zealand and Australia in 1876–77. Two matches against a combined Australian XI were later classified as the first official Test matches. The first match was won by Australia, by 45 runs and the second by England. After
                        reciprocal tours established a pattern of international cricket, The Ashes was established as a competition during the Australian tour of England in 1882. A surprise victory for Australia inspired a mock obituary of English cricket
                        to be published in the Sporting Times the following day: the phrase "The body shall be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia" prompted the subsequent creation of the Ashes urn. The series of 1884–85 was the first to be held
                        over five matches: England player Alfred Shaw, writing in 1901, considered the side to be "the best ever to have left England".</p>


                    <p class="heading rf mb20"><i><b>History of Test cricket from 1877 to 1883</b></i></p>
                    <p class="mb20"> Test matches in the period 1877 to 1883 were organised somewhat differently from international cricket matches today. All were between Australian and English sides, the teams were rarely representative, and the lengthy boat trip required
                        was one that many cricketers (especially amateurs) were unable or unwilling to undertake. As such, the home teams enjoyed a great advantage.</p>
                    <p>Thirteen Test Matches were played during the period between Australian and English sides. Most were not styled as representative "England v. Australia" contests, however: this description was only applied later by cricket statisticians.
                        The same is true of their designation as "Test matches", which did not enter into the vernacular until 1885.[citation needed] Eleven of the thirteen matches played to 1883 were in Australia, where the colonials made the most of
                        their home advantage, winning seven while England won four, and two matches were drawn.</p>
                    <p>By 1883, the tradition of England-Australia tours was well established, that year having concluded the first Ashes series. When England lost at home for the first time in 1882, The Sporting Times lamented the death of cricket in the
                        mother country and declared that "the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia". England captain Ivo Bligh promised that on the tour to Australia in 1882–83 he would regain "the ashes" and the term began to be established.
                        During that tour a small terracotta urn was presented to Bligh by a group of Melbourne women. The urn is commonly, but erroneously, believed to be the trophy of the Ashes series, but it has never been formally adopted as such and
                        Bligh always considered it to be a personal gift.</p>
                    <p class="mb25">The Stanford Super Series was held in October 2008 between three teams. The respective winners of the English and Caribbean Twenty20 competitions, Middlesex and Trinidad and Tobago, and a Stanford Superstars team formed from West Indies
                        domestic players. Trinidad and Tobago won the competition, securing US$280,000 prize money. On 1 November, the Stanford Superstars played England in what was expected to be the first of five fixtures in as many years with the winner
                        claiming US$20,000,000 in each match. The Stanford Superstars won the first matA number of the problems that continue to bedevil cricket today had already surfaced by 1883: there were umpiring disputes, betting controversies, match-fixing,
                        and even a riot.ch, but no further fixtures were held as Allen Stanford was charged with fraud in 2009.</p>

                    <p class="heading fr2 mb20"><i><b>The first Test</b></i></p>
                    <p><img src="img\T2.jpg" alt="h1" class="pro_img2" style="height: 500px;width: 350px;"></p>
                    <p class="mb20"> At 1.05 p.m. on 15 March 1877, the first Test began. It was dominated by Charles Bannerman, who scored the first single in Test history off Alfred Shaw's second ball, was dropped on ten by Tom Armitage off the same bowler (who himself
                        would drop Bannerman twice) and had 27 by lunch at 14:00, with the Combined XI 42 for three. Bannerman increased his scoring rate after the interval and reached his century at 16:25, by which time the crowd was around 4,500. By
                        the close of play at 5 p.m., he had moved on to 126, and Combined Australia had made 166 for six.</p>
                    <p>On the second day, the attendance of about 4,000 spectators was found to include "a large number of spectators...supposed to have got in free, by means of tickets not sold at the gates, but procured illegitimately somewhere else",
                        and about 500 heads watching over the fence from outside the ground. Bannerman took his score to 165 on the second day before he was forced to retire hurt after a delivery from George Ulyett split the index finger of his right
                        hand. Australia was 240 for 7 at that stage; the innings promptly collapsed to 245 all out. Bannerman had scored 67% of the runs in the innings, which remains a record today.His score is still the highest by an Australian on Test
                        debut, and the thirteenth highest by all debutants. His performance so impressed the public that a subscription was initiated, which raised £83 7s 6d for him.</p>
                    <P>The England XI first innings was opened by Jupp and Selby at about 3 p.m. It was immediately apparent that the Australian fielding was "hurried" and "reckless" in contrast with that seen earlier from the "well-drilled Englishmen",
                        and the batsmen amused the crowd by running quick singles after tapping the ball a few yards. By close of play at 5 p.m., England had made 109 for the loss of four wickets, Jupp having contributed 54 not out, after dislodging a
                        bail with his foot and being given not out in the first of many controversial umpiring decisions in Ashes history.</P>
                    <P>On the third day, a Saturday, play started earlier at 12:15. An estimated 9,000 to 12,000 spectators saw the visitors eventually dismissed for 196, 49 short of their colonial opponents. When the Australians batted again at 3.30 p.m.,
                        Bannerman bravely opened the innings but was dismissed for four. Lillywhite's XI attacked fiercely with fast bowling, Shaw taking five for 38 and Ulyett three for 39. By the close, Australia had been reduced to 83 for nine, a lead
                        of just 132.</P>
                    <P class="mb25">On the fourth afternoon, Australia's last-wicket stand extended the lead to 153, and Lillywhite's XI collapsed to 108 all out in just over two hours. Australia thus won by 45 runs, and the crowd was vociferous in its congratulations.
                        Captain Dave Gregory, was given a gold medal by the Victorian Cricket Association, while his team-mates received silver medals. Losing captain James Lillywhite was magnanimous in defeat. "The win," he said, "was a feather in their
                        cap and a distinction that no Englishman will begrudge them ."</P>

                    <p class="heading rf mb20"><i><b>The second Test</b></i></p>
                    <p><img src="img\T3.jpg" alt="h1" class="pro_img" style="height: 400px;width: 350px;"></p>
                    <p class="mb20">Following the success of the first Test, a second was quickly arranged, with the tourists taking a larger slice of the gate receipts. Melbourne Cricket Club contributed £50 to the cost of bringing New South Welshmen, such as Spofforth
                        and Murdoch, down to Melbourne. Lillywhite's team proved itself stronger than The Australasian had suggested, and went on to win the match.</p>
                    <p>On the first day, Australia won the toss but was tied down completely by the English bowlers. Billy Midwinter top-scored with 31 as Australia struggled slowly to 122 in 112.1 four-ball overs. Australia struck back immediately, however,
                        leaving England seven for two at the close. The attendance that first Saturday was poor, with only 4,500 paying to get into the ground.</p>
                    <P>The second day was all England's, as a solid performance took the score to 261 all out at the close, a lead of 139. Lillywhite's XI was so dominant that there were rumours that they had deliberately underperformed in the first game
                        so as to secure better odds from bookmakers on winning the second, or at the very least bolster gate receipts.</P>
                    <P>England was still on top on the third day, despite a better Australian performance: at stumps, the hosts were 207 for seven, Lillywhite himself having picked up four wickets. Only 1,500 were watching by the time his side was set 121
                        to win on the Wednesday. Victory was secured by early afternoon.</P>
                    <P>Test Matches, particularly the first one, greatly excited the colonial press. There was little coverage in England, however, and it was only later, once they were recognised as Tests, that any real note was taken of them there.</P>
