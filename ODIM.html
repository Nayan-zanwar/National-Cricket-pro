                    <p class="mb20"> A One Day International (ODI) is a form of limited overs cricket, played between two teams with international status, in which each team faces a fixed number of overs, currently 50, with the game lasting up to 8 hours. The Cricket
                        World Cup, generally held every four years, is played in this format. One Day International matches are also called Limited Overs Internationals (LOI), although this generic term may also refer to Twenty20 International matches.
                        They are major matches and considered the highest standard of List A, limited-overs competition.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb20"> The international one day game is a late-twentieth-century development. The first ODI was played on 5 January 1971 between Australia and England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. When the first three days of the third Test were washed
                        out officials decided to abandon the match and, instead, play a one-off one day game consisting of 40 eight-ball overs per side. Australia won the game by 5 wickets. ODIs were played in white-colored kits with a red-colored ball.</p>
                    <p class="mb20"> The game has succeeded in spreading around the cricket world. On most international tours there is at least one Twenty20 match and all Test-playing nations have a domestic cup competition. West IndIn the late 1970s, Kerry Packer established
                        the rival World Series Cricket competition, and it introduced many of the features of One Day International cricket that are now commonplace, including colored uniforms, matches played at night under floodlights with a white ball
                        and dark sight screens, and, for television broadcasts, multiple camera angles, effects microphones to capture sounds from the players on the pitch, and on-screen graphics. The first of the matches with coloured uniforms was the
                        WSC Australians in wattle gold versus WSC West Indians in coral pink, played at VFL Park in Melbourne on 17 January 1979. ies are currently the defending world champions, after winning the 2016 World Cup.</p>
                    <p class="mb20"> This led not only to Packer's Channel 9 getting the TV rights to cricket in Australia but also led to players worldwide being paid to play, and becoming international professionals, no longer needing jobs outside cricket. Matches played
                        with coloured kits and a white ball became more commonplace over time, and the use of white flannels and a red ball in ODIs ended in 2001.</P>

                    <p class="heading rf mb20"><i><b>Origins</b></i></p>
                    <p class="mb20"> The idea for a one-day, limited 50-over cricket tournament, was first played in the inaugural match of the All India Pooja Cricket Tournament in 1951 at Tripunithura in Kochi, Kerala. It is thought to be the brain child of KV Kelappan
                        Thampuran, a former cricketer and the first Secretary of the Kerala Cricket Association.The one day limited over cricket game was later adapted and played between English county teams for the first instance on 2 May 1962. Leicestershire
                        beat Derbyshire and Northamptonshire beat Nottinghamshire over 65 overs in the "Midlands Knock-Out Cup", which Northamptonshire went on to win a week later.</p>
                    <p class="mb20"> The following year, the first full-scale one-day competition between first-class teams was played, the knock-out Gillette Cup, won by Sussex. The number of overs was reduced to 60 for the 1964 season. League one-day cricket also began
                        in England, when the John Player Sunday League was started in 1969 with forty over matches. Both these competitions have continued every season since inauguration, though the sponsorship has changed. There is now one 50 over competition,
                        which is called the Royal London One-Day Cup.</p>
                    <p class="mb20"> The first Limited Overs International (LOI) or One-Day International (ODI) match was played in Melbourne in 1971, and the quadrennial cricket World Cup began in 1975. Many of the "packaging" innovations, such as coloured clothing,
                        were as a result of World Series Cricket, a "rebel" series set up outside the cricketing establishment by Australian entrepreneur Kerry Packer. For more details, see History of cricket.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb20"> Twenty20, a curtailed form of one-day cricket with 20 overs per side, was first played in England in 2003. It has proven very popular, and several Twenty20 matches have been played between national teams. It makes several changes to
                        the usual laws of cricket, including the addition of a "bowl-out" (similar to a penalty shoot-out in football) to decide the result of tied matches, which was subsequently dispensed in favour of a Super Over.</p>
                    <p class="mb20"> 100-ball cricket (2.5-hour games), another form of one-day cricket with 100 deliveries per side, will launch in England in 2021. It is designed to further shorten game time and hopes to attract a new audience. It makes further changes
                        to the usual laws of cricket, such as the involvement of overs that last 5 balls each.</p>
                    <p class="mb20"> There are now also T10 leagues with a format of 10 overs per side (resulting in 90-minute games). The Emirates Cricket Board also launched Ninety–90 Bash, an upcoming annual franchise-based 90-ball cricket league in the United Arab
                        Emirates.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb20"> Chennai hosted an ODI match between India and New Zealand in 2010. The New Zealand batsman is in black, and India in blue are the fielding team.One Day International matches are usually played in brightly coloured clothing often in
                        a "day-night" format where the first innings of the day occurs in the afternoon and the second occurs under stadium lights.</p>

                    <p class="mb20"> Thirteen teams from different parts of the country participated in Pakistan's inaugural competition in 2004, with the Faisalabad Wolves the first winners. On 12 January 2005 Australia's first Twenty20 game was played at the WACA Ground
                        between the Western Warriors and the Victorian Bushrangers. It drew a sell-out crowd of 20,000, which was the first one in nearly 25 years.</p>
                    <p>Starting on 11 July 2006, 19 West Indies regional teams competed in what was named the Stanford 20/20 tournament. The event was financially backed by billionaire Allen Stanford, who gave at least US$28,000,000 in funding money. It
                        was intended that the tournament would be an annual event. Guyana won the inaugural event, defeating Trinidad and Tobago by five wickets, securing US$1,000,000 in prize money.</p>
                    <p>On 5 January 2007 the Queensland Bulls played the New South Wales Blues at The Gabba, Brisbane. An unexpected 16,000 fans turned up on the day to buy tickets, causing Gabba staff to throw open gates and grant many fans free entry.
                        Attendance reached 27,653. For the February 2008 Twenty20 match between Australia and India, 85,824people attended the match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, involving the Twenty20 World Champions against the ODI World Champions.</p>
                    <p class="mb25">The Stanford Super Series was held in October 2008 between three teams. The respective winners of the English and Caribbean Twenty20 competitions, Middlesex and Trinidad and Tobago, and a Stanford Superstars team formed from West Indies
                        domestic players. Trinidad and Tobago won the competition, securing US$280,000 prize money. On 1 November, the Stanford Superstars played England in what was expected to be the first of five fixtures in as many years with the winner
                        claiming US$20,000,000 in each match. The Stanford Superstars won the first match, but no further fixtures were held as Allen Stanford was charged with fraud in 2009.</p>
                    <div class="section_title "></div>

                    <p class="heading rf mb20"><i><b>Trial regulations</b></i></p>
                    <p><img src="img\M02.jpg" alt="h1" class="pro_img2" style="height: 250px;width: 400px;"></p>
                    <p class="mb20"> The trial regulations also introduced a substitution rule that allowed the introduction of a replacement player at any stage in the match and until he was called up to play he assumed the role of 12th man. Teams nominated their replacement
                        player, called a Supersub, before the toss. The Supersub could bat, bowl, field or keep wicket once a player was replaced; the replaced player took over the role of 12th man. Over the six months it was in operation, it became very
                        clear that the Supersub was of far more benefit to the side that won the toss, unbalancing the game. </p>
                    <p class="mb25">Several international captains reached "gentleman's agreements" to discontinue this rule late in 2005. They continued to name Supersubs, as required, but they did not field them by simply using them as a normal 12th man. On 15 February
                        2006, the ICC announced their intention to discontinue the Supersub rule on 21 March 2006. 2 balls were trialed in ODI for 2 years but it was rejected.</p>

                    <p class="mb20">Each team bats only once, and each innings is limited to a set number of overs, usually fifty in a One Day International and between forty and sixty in a List A. List A is a classification of the limited-overs (one-day) form of cricket,
                        technically as the domestic level.</p>
                    <p>Despite its name, important one-day matches, international and domestic, often have two days set aside, the second day being a "reserve" day to allow more chance of the game being completed if a result is not possible on the first
                        day (for instance if play is prevented or interrupted by rain).</p>

                    <p class="mb20">As mentioned above, in almost all competitive one-day games, a restriction is placed on the number of overs that may be bowled by any one bowler. This is to prevent a side playing two top-class bowlers with extremely good stamina who
                        can bowl throughout their opponents' innings. </p>
                    <p>The usual limitation is set so that a side must include at least five players who bowl i.e. each bowler can only bowl 20% of the overs. For example, the usual limit for twenty-over cricket is four overs per bowler, for forty-over cricket
                        eight per bowler and for fifty-over cricket ten per bowler.There are exceptions: Pro Cricket in the United States restricted bowlers to five overs each, thus leaving a side requiring only four bowlers.
